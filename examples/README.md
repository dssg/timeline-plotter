# Example Timelines

This directory contains example uses of the timeline plotter using publicly
available data sets.

The [African American achivements](african_american_achievements/) example
shows plotting a single timeline for a few different categories of data to see
how the frequency of events varies over time and between event types (first
recorded achievements for African Americans in a variety of domains).

The [hotel bookings](hotel_bookings/) explores how different travel agents book
hotels by plotting the booking history for a sample of agents.

The [train delays](train_delays/) looks at the average departure delay for
French trains by their departure and arrival stations. This example shows using
the y-axis to display a value associated with an event (the average length of
the delay for a given route).
